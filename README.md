# Negotiation Chatbot

## Overview

This project implements a negotiation chatbot designed to simulate a negotiation process between a customer and a supplier. The chatbot utilizes sentiment analysis and predefined pricing logic to enhance the negotiation experience. It can handle multiple products, engage in back-and-forth dialogues, and generate a dataset for training.
